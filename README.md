# DMX-Dashboard-LOWCOST
### log: 28.12.2025
this is my attempt on creating a lowcost DMX dashboard based on Midi, as it allows easy integration of faders and knobs.
as for controller choice, i think i will go with an RP2040 as i have bought one to try out, and i have not worked with it yet.
i don't know if it will be hard to add motorised faders, but i guess we will find out.
maybe i will stick to the Arduino C++ language to profit from its extensive library support, and because i have some experience using it.
as for the exterior, i will be 3d printing its shell because thats what i am familiar with.
